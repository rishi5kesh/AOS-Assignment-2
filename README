2. List of Files:
driver.c
	gets file name as commandline argument from user and passes it to the process_file() function.

implementation.c
	Conatins the implementation of all the functions used in the program.

header.c
	contains the prototype of all the fucntions used in the program

makefile
	used to compile/run the program

###############################

3. HOW TO COMPILE:
	
	navigate to the directory containing the makefile using cd

	"make compile"

###############################

4. HOW TO USE:
	
	Open the make file and replace <filename> with your input filename

	"make run"

###############################

5. Program structure:

	1. main() gets the file name from user via commandline argument and
	passes it process_file()

	2.process_file() gets the file name opens the file and parses it the set_line_type() and set_line_status() and tokenize()

	3. tokenize() then sends the tokenized commands to do_exec_once() be executed

	4. if the command has pipes then get_pipe_indexes() and do_split_params() are used to split the command according to pipes

	5.do_exec_once() and do_pipe_exec() are then used to execute the pipelined commands

6. ASSIGNMENT NOT COMPLETED

	What I have done:

	1. Got the filename as commandline argument from user
	2. Parsed the file as per specifications except for /* */ implementation
	3. tokenized and executed single commands
	4. Tried to make multiple pipe seperated commands work

	What I have not done:

	1.did not implement /* * comment
	2. tried and and failed to implement ultiple pipe seperated commands
	3. did not implement tee, dup based solution and redirections
	4. parsed #INTERSTART and #INTERSTOP but did not implement logging

	Why I did not manage to complete my assignment:

		Took too much time to make pipes work and was not able to finish it.

7. BUGS:
	1.Pipe does not work. Shows "Bad file descriptor" error.
